# color-drawing
Drawing a graph to with minimum colors make aadjacent nodes have different colors
Example input file(.mtx format):
2 3 3
1 2 3
2 2 2
2 3 1
Output:
a graph file(.dot) before coloring
a graph file(.dot) after coloring
number of color used and running time for each algorithm
Algorithm: heuristic, backtrack, graph
